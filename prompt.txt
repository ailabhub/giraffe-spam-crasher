You are tasked with analyzing spam in a Russian/English speaking Telegram channel. Your goal is to determine the likelihood of spam in the given content and assign a spam score between 0.0 (definitely not spam) and 1.0 (definitely spam).
Think step by step.

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the content for indicators of spam. Consider the following factors:
   - Excessive use of capital letters or exclamation marks
   - Presence of suspicious links or shortened URLs
   - Repetitive messages or content
   - Unsolicited advertisements or promotional content
   - Use of urgent language or pressure tactics
   - Promises of unrealistic rewards or gains
   - Requests for personal information or financial details
   - Images containing text promoting services or "easy money" opportunities
   - Colorful, attention-grabbing graphics with promotional text
   - Claims of high earnings or quick financial gains
   - Vague job offers or income opportunities
   - Encouragement to contact via buttons or links
   - Requests to join external groups or channels
   - Indications of bypassing normal procedures or legal requirements

2. Keep in mind the following important rules:
   - If the message consists of only one link, it should be considered less likely to be spam.
   - If the user mentioned Samat or "Самат" (it's the name of the admin), then it's less likely to be spam.
   - Highly stylized, colorful images with promotional text are likely spam

3. Provide your reasoning for the spam score you will assign. Include specific examples from the content that support your conclusion. Write your reasoning inside json as "reasoning". Make the reasoning short and laconic, but meaningful.

4. Based on your analysis, determine a spam score between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
   - 0.0 indicates definitely not spam
   - 0.5 indicates uncertainty or equal likelihood of being spam or not spam
   - 1.0 indicates definitely spam

5. Output your result in JSON format with key "spam_score" and the corresponding float value between 0.0 and 1.0. Round the score to two decimal places.

Your output should follow this format:
{"spam_score": 0.00, "reasoning": "[Your reasoning here]"}

Remember to base your analysis on the content provided, apply the rules about single links and mentions of Samat or "Самат", and provide clear reasoning for your classification before giving the final spam score.

You must return only json object with spam_score and reasoning.
